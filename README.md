New York City (NYC), home to millions of people, faces the challenge that many big cities encounter. Overpopulation and an inflated housing market makes it difficult for many people to afford shelter. Because housing is so expensive, NYC experiences one of the highest rates of homelessness in the country, ranking at number 2. Analyzing these datasets will allow us to determine whether there has been an increase in the homeless population in different boroughs and to investigate if there is a correlation between the rise in homlessness and the number of encampment complaints. This analysis also provides an interesting perspective on the areas where a high number of encampment complaints originate.
